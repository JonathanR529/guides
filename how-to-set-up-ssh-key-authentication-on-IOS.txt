Hello and welcome to this small guyd.
In this guyd we will show you how to setup ssh key authentication on ios.
First, lets genorate sum ssh keys
this can be dun on windows by downloading putty, (link below) and running the puttYgen.
first download putty from this link, https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
Then run and set up the installer.
Now run the PuttYgen from your start menu.
Select the Ed25519 radio button.
Press genorate.
Now inport the key and convert the private key.
Name it id_ED25519.pub
If your on linux or mac os follow thees steps
To genorate your key run this command in the terminal.
ssh-keygen -t Ed2519
Ok, so now you should have your ed25519 key files that you need.
Now connect to your phone thrue an sftp client,, or just some how get your id_ed25519.pub in to /var/root/authorized_keys
Now ssh in to your phone and run the following commands
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 0700 ~/.ssh
mv ~/authorized_keys ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod go-w /private/var/root
There you go,your essentially done, How ever, we strongly recommend disabling password authentication.
This can be done by editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
uncomment the line that reads PasswordAuthentication  yes, and change yes to no.
also to insure that the ssh key authentication works uncomment the line that says PubkeyAuthentication yes.
now you are rilly done.
